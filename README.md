# Geographical-plotting-using-plotly

The 2 .ipynb files contain codes for interactive geographical plots. The plot was not showing up in GitHub, so images were uploaded separately.
Since the images are .png files, they are not interactive. 
However if the code in run in a suitable IDE, it will create an interactive plot, as per features of Plotly's iplot module.
